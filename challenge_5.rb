# Start with an array of travel destinations. Print every travel destination in alphabetical order embedded in a sentence using string interpolation. For example, if the destination is "New York City", print something like "The next place I want to visit is New York City!"

# Challenge in My Words:
# Alphabetize each element of an array and then interpolate into a sentence.

# Pseudocode:
# 1. Put the elements in alphabetical order using a method --sort
# 2. Run through each element of the array
# 3. Print a sentence for each element
